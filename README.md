		- Allow a filtering by major time period
		- Which speeches have similarities are different (distance)
		- The transition to the next period is to select some speeches.

	- Visualization 2: Similar to above, but with Micro Text Line.  X axis would be time.  Y axis would be an index score.  Each line would be showing the increase/decrease of score over time, for example Flesch reading level score.  Brath pg 139

## 2B.  Topic:  Ordered Speeches by Criteria, showing initial words from each.   

### Research Question:  I want to show beginnings of speeches, with special ordering (say by Flesch Score, or other dimensions) 

- Significance:  In order to understand the scoring what scored/high/low and encourage user to explore to the lowest level

	- Visualization 4:  Speech Level View show the speeches ranked by criteria (rank n , highest/lowest).  Click down opens Topic 3, individual complete speech

		- Expectation: get to the individual speech

## 3 Topic: Individual Speech, complete

### Research Question:  Show the entire speech.  What was actually said?  

- Significance: How can we get additional context highlighting clues to understand this individual speech and what makes it unique
